Simplicity of design is the key to <b>usability</b>. We accept if the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary
for simple things. Many products defy understanding simply because they have too many functions and controls. This means that
not only must the requirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be satisfied, but attention must be paid to the entire 
experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the quality of interaction. Engineers make the mistake of thinking that 
logical explanation is sufficient: “If only people would read the instructions,” they say, “everything would be all right.” but
the usability of a product leans a lot on how intuitive it is to use.

Usability can be analyzed via <b>Heuristic Evaluation</b>. It involves having a small set of evaluators examine the interface
and judge its compliance with recognized usability principles having each individual evaluator inspect the interface alone.
Only after all evaluations have been completed are the evaluators allowed to communicate and have their findings aggregated.
There is an observer (normally called the "experimenter") who has the responsibility of interpreting the user's actions in
order to infer how these actions are related to the usability issues in the design of the interface.

When people use something, they face two gulfs: the Gulf of Execution, where they try to figure out how it operates, and the
Gulf of Evaluation, where they try to figure out what happened. The role of a designer is to help people bridge the
two gulfs. Gulf of Execution is bridged through the use of signifiers, constraints, mappings, and a conceptual model, while
the Gulf of Evaluation is bridged through the use of feedback and a conceptual model. For e.g, a regular coffee machine can be
evaluated under these two gulfs. If you have not used a coffee machine before, it is not really intuitive as to where to put
the coffee or the water, but after using it once, or when you are used to using a machine. The gulf of evaluation leads to us
believe whether the coffee was made or not. Also, 'Visibility of System Status' is one Jakob Nielsen's principle which is 
voilated as throughout the process, we do not get any status of what is happening.

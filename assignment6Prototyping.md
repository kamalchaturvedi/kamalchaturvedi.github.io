In many fields that require creativity and engineering skill, such as architecture and automobile
design, prototypes both inform the design process and help designers select the best solution.
Prototype as a concrete representation of part or all of an interactive system is a tangible artifact,
not an abstract description that requires interpretation. Designers,as well as managers, developers, customers and end users,
can use these artifacts to envision and to reflect upon the final system. For e.g, Hardware and software engineers often
create prototypes to study the feasibility of a technical process. They conduct systematic, scientific evaluations with
respect to predefined benchmarks and, by systematically varying parameters, fine tune the system.

Prototyping techniques are analyzed under the following dimentions. <b>Representation</b> refers to the type of prototype, i.e.
either online or offline. Offline prototypes (also called “paper prototypes”) do not require a computer, & include paper
sketches, illustrated storyboards, cardboard mock ups and videos, while online protypes require a computer. Offline prototypes
can be created by a wide range of people, not just programmers. Thus all types of designers, technical or otherwise, as well as
users, managers, and other interested parties, can all contribute on an equal basis. Unlike programming software, modifying a
storyboard or cardboard mock up requires no particular technical skill.

<b>Precision</b> refers to the relevance of details with respect to the purpose of the prototype. The forms of the prototypes
reflect their level of precision: sketches tend not to be precise, whereas computer simulations are usually
very precise. Graphic designers often prefer using hand sketches for early prototypes because the drawing style can directly
reflect what is precise and what is not: the wiggly shape of an object or a squiggle that represents a label are directly perceived
as imprecise. <b>Interactivity</b> is to illustrate how the user will interact with the system. While this may seem
more natural with online prototypes, in fact it is often easier to explore different interaction strategies with offline prototypes.
<b>Evolution</b> refers to how a prototype evolves with time. Rapid prototypes are especially important in the early stages of design. They must be inexpensive and easy to produce, since
the goal is to quickly explore a wide variety of possible types of interaction and then throw them away. It is highly advocated 
that we should begin with rapid prototypes and then using iterative or evolutionary prototypes according to the needs of the project.

There are certain iterative and evolutionary prototyping techniques for working out the details of the online interaction,
which include development tools and software environments. Fields of mixed reality and pervasive computing use similar
concepts, while also include new challenges in regards to interactive systems design, as well as some of the tools
available for prototyping them. Prototyping supports creativity, helps developers capture and generate ideas, facilitate the
exploration of a design space, and uncover relevant information about users and their work practices. They encourage
communication, helping designers, engineers, managers, software developers, customers and users to discuss options and interact with each other.

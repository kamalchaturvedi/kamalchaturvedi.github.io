This section is a discussion around a [case study of IDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dtrkrz0yoU)

Q. This video is about 20 years old! Which ideas from this work show up in today's shopping carts? Which ideas did not make it,
and why didn't they?

Ans. Most of the shopping carts we see today do not really have implementation of any of the ideas talked about in the video, except child carriage space. 
The main reason behind it is that they were trying too hard to solve a already solved design problem. Let's talk about these ideas one-by-one :
1. Scanning devices on the cart : It is practically infeasible to have a scanning device installed & maintained for each of the shopping carts present in a store.
Having a self-checkout section solves this problem more efficiently, as they are limited fully functional systems optimized for ease of use.

2. Voice control on the cart : Even thought this was a good idea, again it needs installation & maintainence. Also, having systems like these installed
makes it more profitable to steal carts from the store.

Q. Who did the design team talk to? For each group of stakeholders that the designers talked to, explain why it was important to talk to them.

Ans. The design team had their discussions with teams which would bring different perspectives, like having the phychologist tell her perspective
about how an idea might pan out with people, and with the ground workers to get their outlook on the implementation possibility given such a short
time frame. There were also regular discussions with the product owner, to give them demonstrations on the POCs (Proof of Concepts) developed & get a
thumbs up on making the final prototype.
This is critical to the success of ideas, as people from different backgrounds might shed light on a idea differently & make the idea more robust.

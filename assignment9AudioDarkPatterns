<h1>Audio and Dark Patterns</h1>
Almost all information presented by computers uses the visual sense. This means information can be missed because of visual
overload or because the user is not looking in the right place at the right time. A multimodal interface that integrates information output to both senses could
capitalize on the interdependence between them and present
information in the most efficient way possible. Crossmodal use of the different
senses allows the characteristics of one sensory modality to
be transformed into stimuli for another sensory modality. Three areas are likely to be important in non-speech auditory design's future growth.
The first is in combining the sound and tactile modalities with
others (vision, force-feedback, etc.) to create multimodal or
crossmodal displays that make the most of the all the senses
available to users. This is an area ripe for further investigation,
and there are many interesting interaction problems that can
be tackled when multiple senses are used together. The second
area in which crossmodal audio and tactile feedback could
play a major role is with multitouch and tabletop interfaces. In
these cases, feedback will be required for separate fingers and
also separate users. Many large touch-screen computers use
direct finger-based multitouch input and a 360-degree user
experience. This configuration means that users should be
able to use the table without restriction no matter where they
are positioned around it. Both audio and tactile feedback could
be advantageous over visual feedback alone. The third area in
which nonspeech sound and tactile feedback has a large part
to play is with mobile/wearable computing devices (again also
in a multimodal or crossmodal form). Small screens cause
many difficult presentation problems, and this is exactly the
situation in which sound or touch has many advantages—they
do not take up any precious screen space and users can hear
or feel it even if they cannot look at their device. In a ubiquitous
setting, there may not even be a screen at all and sound
or tactile feedback can provide information on the services
available in a particular environment in a nonintrusive way.

The concept of "dark patterns" has been raised by UX practitioners in conjunction with ethical concerns related to design.
We use the term dark patterns to define instances where designers use their knowledge of human behavior (e.g., psychology)
and the desires of end users to implement deceptive functionality that is not in the user’s best interest.
There are dominant ethics or value-related methods UX practitioners have used to address this space. Value-Sensitive Design
is a theoretically grounded approach to the design of technology that accounts for human values in a principled and 
comprehensive manner throughout the design process, while Critical & Reflective Design approach builds upon traditional practices
but rather than resulting in artifacts that affirm current societal norms, the designer creates artifacts or experiences that
allow key societal norms and values to be openly interpreted and questioned. Another approach i.e. Persuasive Design is about
creating intentional changes in the world that either directly/indirectly induces behavioral or social change.

Upon analyzing different sets of exemplars, 5 primary categories of designer strategies can be referred to as dark patterns.

> Nagging : Redirection of expected functionality that persists beyond one or more interactions.
> Obstruction : Making a process more difficult than it needs to be, with the intent of dissuading certain action(s).
> Sneaking : Attempting to hide, disguise, or delay the divulging of information that is relevant to the user.
> Interface Interference : Manipulation of the user interface that privileges certain actions over others.
> Forced Action : Requiring the user to perform a certain action to access (or continue to access) certain functionality.

This categorization seeks to articulate strategic motivators through a rigorous scholarly process of integrating, refining,
and theorizing—consistent with the development of grounded theory.

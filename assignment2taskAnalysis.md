Task Analysis
=============

For a given task, its analysis is how to approach the given problem at hand. It can be either done simply by task decomposition, might need us to understand
the domain thoroughly & identify how this knowledge is organized, or it might also need us to identify relationships between the different actors involved in 
the task. The three types talked about above as be listed as HTA (Hierarchical Task Analysis), KBA (Knowledge Based Analysis) & ERBA (Entity-Relationship Based Analysis)
, respectively.

HTA involves restructuring the hierarchy of tasks & sub-tasks involved, to identify the order in which the tasks need to be performed. Expanding a task should only be done when
they are critical, or by evaluating the PxC rule, i.e. the probability of making a mistake in the task multiplied by cost of the mistake. If it is below a threshold, there is no need
if expansion. Typically in a hierarchy , we have the following type of plan patterns : fixed sequence, optional tasks, waiting events, cycles, time shared, discretionary & mixtures. There are certain tasks which require heavy domain knowledge in that field, & that is where KBA is helpful. KBA involves building taxonomies  related to the objects & actions involved with the tasks. This domain knowledge can either be gathered by talking to a worker who is directly involved with the task, rather than from people indirectly related (like a manager managing that worker). Generating taxonomy can be useful to structure the presentation & description of objects & actions, especially for teaching purposes. While HTA & KBA deal with defining these objects & actions related to the task, ERBA is associated with finding relationships between these objects & actions. Also, closely allied to actions is the idea of an event, i.e. when an action happens.

Task Analysis can be applied to multiple usecases like HTA can be utilized to structure general purpose manuals, while for structuring a course, KBA will be beneficial. Also, existing systems can be studied via these task analysis techniques to structure a new kind of system or design.

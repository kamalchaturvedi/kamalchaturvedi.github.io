Formative research refers to the conducting of user-centred research, where we plan our research activites to better understand our
target user population.

One such study conducted is The Presence Project, which wanted to study the elderly living in certain sites like Oslo (Norway), Bijlmer (Netherland) & Peccioli (Italy). The intention of the research was to get an impressionistic account of 
their beliefs & disbeliefs, their aestheic preferences & cultural concerns. The elderly were considered for the research as they represent a life free from the need to work, & hence can be defined as the humanity defined by its playful
qualities (Homo Ludens). They approached the research problem as artist-designers perspective, rather than the general science & engineering based approaches. They sent out probes as packages of maps to explore their attitude towards the
environment, as postcards asking questions related to their personal lives & influence of technology, & as photo albums to understand how they interact with the people around them.

This project was to address common dilemmas in developing projects for unfamiliar demographics or groups. By understanding their cultures, it would better help designers understand whether their designs were irrelevant, arrogant or provocative.

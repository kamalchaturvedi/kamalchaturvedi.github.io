Formative research refers to the conducting of user-centred research, where we plan our research activites to better understand our
target user population.

One such study conducted is The Presence Project, which wanted to study the elderly living in certain sites like Oslo (Norway), Bijlmer (Netherland) & Peccioli (Italy). The intention of the research was to get an impressionistic account of 
their beliefs & disbeliefs, their aestheic preferences & cultural concerns. The elderly were considered for the research as they represent a life free from the need to work, & hence can be defined as the humanity defined by its playful
qualities (Homo Ludens). They approached the research problem as artist-designers perspective, rather than the general science & engineering based approaches. They sent out probes as packages of maps to explore their attitude towards the
environment, as postcards asking questions related to their personal lives & influence of technology, & as photo albums to understand how they interact with the people around them. This project was to address common dilemmas in developing projects for unfamiliar demographics or groups. By understanding their cultures, it would better help designers understand whether their designs were irrelevant, arrogant or provocative.

Also, as per another study called 'A diary study of Mobile Information Needs', the researchers tried to understand what kind of information mobile users typically require, to identify what ways do these people employ to find an answer to this information. So they recruited 20 participants which were a good mix of different sex, occupations & age-groups, & asked them to keep a diary for 2 weeks to record their information needs when they were away from home & work. As a result of the study, the researchers identified that these participants had 4 different kinds of information needs : visceral, conscious, formalized & compromised. Also, the participants told that they could have been able to find the information by accessing the web, their email, or other sources like books & articles. Understanding the data sources which were frequently helpful for addressing these kind of information needs can be really helpful for guide the development of state-of-the-art mobile technologies. 

On the basis of these studies & the kind of formative research these researchers performed, it is clear that it can help identify useful behavioral characteristics about our target users.

In this section, we discuss about Personas. Personas in design & development of products refer to the imagination of a group of
users who would be interacting with the product, & hence need to be considered as per their perceived usage behaviour & peculiar
characteristics.

Designing products for a broad spectrum of public might satisfy 50% of the target audience by 50%, while if we just develop for
the 10% of the target user base, we would be able to develop a product that can satisfy them by 100%. You will find that the features
that please some users will interfere with the enjoyment & satisfaction of others. Hence, narrowing the focus audience can help
generate fanatical customer loyalty in our target market.

While defining a persona, naming them is one of the most important part, as it builds a picture of a concrete individual in front
of us. When defining requirements, we can specify by the persona name which user might need it, while for which user it might not
be useful. Having Personas with different races, genders, nationalities & colors might actually help, if their use-case for the product
would be different. It will actually not be a bad idea to also put a face to each of the personas, to give more relatability.

Generally, programming is defined by general & edge cases, while design is defined for the center of the paradigm, and it is at that
center the ideal personas for that product lie. Since programmers with their mathematical nature tend to think of specific use-cases, rather
than the general ones, which makes them think about users in general/average or the generic. While, if a programmer would start
thinking in terms of personas, it can help him prioritise work & relate more close to the thinking of a designer.
